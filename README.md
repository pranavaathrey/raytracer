### Implemented Techniques
- Ray-traced reflections and shadows.
- Lambertian diffused lighting.
- Phong specular reflections.
- Ray-traced refractions.
- Fresnel effect reflections using Schlick's approximation.
- HDRI backgrounds.

### Credits
The [guide](https://gabrielgambetta.com/computer-graphics-from-scratch) I used to implement this. Thanks to Gabriel Gambetta.

Used various wikipedia articles to implement a few of the features in this project.

Uses [SFML](https://www.sfml-dev.org/) to output the image.
